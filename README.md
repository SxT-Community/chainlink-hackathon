## Overview

Welcome to the Chainlink Hackathon Guideline for Space and Time - Space and time is a Web3-native data platform that connects tamper-proof blockchain data with your off-chain datasets.

Here's what you can do with Space and Time:

- **Combine on-chain and off-chain data:** With Space and Time, you can link up tamper-proof blockchain data we've gathered from major chains with your off-chain data to create new business logic.
- **Trustless data for smart contracts:** You can send tamper-proof query results to smart contracts in a trustless way or publish query results directly on-chain using our novel Proof of SQL cryptographic guarantees.
- **API Gateway:** Publish datasets and queries directly to APIs, build dapps on top of Space and Time, and scale easily to 10s of TBs and thousands of concurrent queries/requests. We have pre-built APIs for SQL operations, blockchain data, Kafka streaming, security, and more.
- **OpenAIPowered UI:** Use our intuitive user interface to create pipelines, dashboards, and natural-language queries with OpenAI.
- **HTAP Data Warehouse:** Enjoy low-latency transactions and scalable analytics in a single cluster.
- **Proof of SQL (coming soon):** We're working on a novel zero-knowledge proof to cryptographically guarantee SQL operations in Space and Time.

As a sponsor of the Chainlink hackathon, we're excited to see the innovative solutions you can build using Space and Time with Chainlink.

## Integration with Chainlink

Space and Time offers two ways to integrate with Chainlink: Direct requests and Chainlink functions. For documentation on direct requests, please refer to [this link](https://docs.spaceandtime.io/docs/chainlink-direct-requests), and for Chainlink functions, please refer to [this link](https://docs.spaceandtime.io/docs/chainlink-functions).

There are some examples of what you can accomplish with Space and Time and Chainlink:

- Dynamic NFTs: Hackers can use Space and Time to bring game telemetry data into the blockchain and create dynamic NFTs that reflect the gamer's performance.
- On-chain Betting Platform: Developers can use Space and Time to get real-time sports data into the blockchain and build an on-chain betting platform
- DeFi liquidity pools: Hackers can use Space and Time to aggregate data from various DeFi liquidity pools and provide users with accurate and reliable information on the pools' performance.
- Staking and Rewards: Developers can distribute exclusive rewards based on the complex on-chain and off-chain data logic. For example, you could give exclusive rewards to BayC NFT owners who hold more than 1000 Chainlink Tokens and are also on the leaderboard with data from off-chain resources.
- Developers can use Space and Time to store and analyze real-time market data, such as stock prices and exchange rates, and build trading algorithms that respond to changes in market conditions.

## Supported Blockchains

Space and Time Network [supports](https://docs.spaceandtime.io/docs/access-blockchain-data) Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and BNB Chain. And for the Testnet networks, SxT will support Polygon Mumbai, Sepolia, and Goerli testnets during the hackathon.

## Network Access

We are providing hackers access to a dApp that they can easily use. To access Space and Time, please visit [https://www.spaceandtime.io/access-beta](https://www.spaceandtime.io/access-beta) and submit your project information. Please also write `chainlink-hackathon` in the about section during submission to ensure you can access the Space and Time Network for the Chainlink hackathon.

After the submission, you will receive an email from us with the onboarding information you need to kick off your journey with Space and Time and start hacking. Please give us up to 1 day as we prepare your developer environment.

## Bounties

We are providing a total of 25K bounties. The breakdown is as follows:

- 15K for the best application built on Space and Time with Chainlink
- 5K for the best partnership integration
- 5K distributed to other submissions with the most creative build on Space and Time

## Bug Triage

As we are in beta, please let us know if you find any bugs while building with Space and Time. We will consider bug triage in the bounty process.

To file bug reports that will be considered in the bounty process, please go to [chainlink hackathon repository](https://github.com/SxT-Community/chainlink-hackaton) and click on the Issues tab and create a new Issue: 

## Communication

We will be active on the Chainlink discord. If you have any questions or need any support, please get in touch with us there. Or come to our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/spaceandtimeDB) channel:
